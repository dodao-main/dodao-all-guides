      # **Overview**


      Balancer is a Protocol built on Ethereum that works as an automated
      portfolio management and trading platform where fees are collected from
      traders to rebalance portfolios by leveraging arbitrage opportunities. 


      Currently, about 17.5 thousand people are committed to Balancer as
      Liquidity Providers (LPs) and have generated $3.4 Billion in liquidity
      since inception.


      Also, as a community-driven organization, Balancerâ€™s governed process is
      decentralized and is operated by members of the community, otherwise known
      as Ballers who hold the governance token. For Balancer, the governance
      token is BAL and is used for every decision-making process within the
      organization.

      # **Balancer Grants DAO**


      The Balancer Grants DAO is a subDAO in the Balancer community that gives
      the opportunity to contributors to build on the Balancer Protocol such
      that it will benefit Balancer. This opportunity comes in the form of
      funding and guidance throughout the building process. 


      The Grants DAO is being managed by a committee that approves based on the
      need for Balancer funds for grantees so they can build easily. 


      The Grants DAO is open to groups and individuals who want to solve a real
      problem for Balancer to optimize an already existing feature, product or
      project. To get ideas on possible are of funding, kindly look at the [RFPs

      pay members of the committee and to manage the subDAO. A breakdown of the
      budget is shown below:

      # **Rewards**


      Contributors who wish to apply to the Balancer Grants DAO can get funded
      by the committee. The funding range is between ($1k - $75k) in BAL tokens
      depending on the size of the project to be implemented.


      The payments are made in installments based on a predefined agreement
      between the grantee and grants committee to ensure that milestones are
      achieved and the risk of not completing the task is minimized.


      Aside from funding, contributors get support in terms of access to mentors
      who work with them to ensure that the projects go on successfully and in
      cases of challenges, they will be able to resolve with the help of the
      mentors.
