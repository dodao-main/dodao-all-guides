      Babylon Finance is a community owned and led asset management protocol
      where users can invest in DeFi together. The platform presents an
      opportunity for members to collaborate with one another to develop
      strategies and products to increase their returns as well as grow the
      community rather than try to navigate the world of DeFi individually.


      Babylon has a two-layer governance system. The protocol is managed by the
      holders of the governance token, $BABL, which is used to vote on changes
      to the protocol and decide on the best use of the protocol treasury. 


      Babylonians can create investment communities (called "Gardens") and
      invite people to deposit capital. Members participate in the garden by
      joining the telegram chat, suggesting investment Strategies and voting on
      Strategies. Members receive rewards based on their contributions.

      # Background

      * Babylon is growing rapidly, there is a need to improve the process of
      onboarding new Babylon users and helping them deposit into their first
      garden.

      * Many in the Babylon community are interested in contributing their time
      and knowledge to help grow the platform as a whole. 

      * This not only provides a mechanism to pay for those contributions, but
      also will help facilitate matching people who want to get involved with
      projects they may be interested in.

      * The core development team doesn't have time to stay up to date with all
      developments across the community. 

      * The Diplomats will act as a community facilitator, helping to better
      coordinate teams, fill information voids, and improve efficiency by
      providing context or involving the right people in a discussion.

      * Babylon’s Discord is seeing an increase in spam posts and is becoming
      difficult to moderate, the Diplomats will help keep Discord a useful and
      quality forum.
